# blindpaint
blindly paint things.

(second README because of git issues...)

## what is a blindpaint
blindpaint is an open-source app made for arch linux users (like me!) so they can paint

obviously, you can't see what you're painting because, like... it's **BLIND**paint...

## running the thing
go to [releases](https://github.com/greg0rygreg/blindpaint/releases/latest) or do it yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/greg0rygreg/blindpaint.git
cd blindpaint # i think
go run .
```

## where did the other README go
rebase issues.............. i hate git
