## other notes
this was made as a way of ~~messing around and finding out but for painting~~ painting for unriced arch linux users

this ISN'T a virus, don't listen to media people. blindpaint is virus free, here's the windows x64 executable sha1sum hash as of pre3 if you want to check it yourself: `254d7d0161bd60304f72ee73735c0b4a3a7f3e8a`

## future notes
~~if blindpaint ever gets cancelled, a DLL/`.so` file will be made so that YOU can remake blindpaint in other languages, like python (by using ctypes)!~~ already made the lib for blindpaint
