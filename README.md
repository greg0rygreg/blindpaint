# blindpaint
blindly paint things.

blindpaint is a console app developed by greg (me) in Golang (Python and C too but that's for the dll)

you press 1, then uhhh, insert canvas size like `3,3`, press 1 again, yapyapyap you know it

## installation
go to releases or compile it yourself
```bash
gh repo clone greg0rygreg/blindpaint #or something..
cd blindpaint
go mod tidy
go build -o blindpaint
```
or use the newly added shared object (`so`) library that i've prepared for 1.0! [here](https://github.com/greg0rygreg/blindpaint/tree/main/dllsource "dllsource folder")


## other notes
this was made as a way of ~~messing around and finding out but for painting~~ painting for unriced arch linux users

this ISN'T a virus, don't listen to media people. blindpaint is virus free, here's the windows x64 executable sha1sum hash as of 1.0 if you want to check it yourself: `bc1e5a05a178cb4582a5159c83b7f05e31c9f60e`

## future notes
~~if blindpaint ever gets cancelled, a DLL/`.so` file will be made so that YOU can remake blindpaint in other languages, like python (by using ctypes)!~~ already made the lib for blindpaint
