## other notes
this was made as a way of ~~messing around and finding out but for painting~~ painting for unriced arch linux users

this ISN'T a virus, don't listen to media people. blindpaint is virus free, here's the windows x64 executable sha1sum hash if you want to check it yourself: `254d7d0161bd60304f72ee73735c0b4a3a7f3e8a`
